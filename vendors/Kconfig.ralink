	help
	  This driver supports the WMC Device Management functionality
	  of cell phones compliant to the CDC WMC specification. You can use
	  AT commands over this device.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cdc-wdm.

config USB_NET_CDC_NCM
	tristate "CDC NCM support"
	depends on USB_USBNET
	default y
	help
	  This driver provides support for CDC NCM (Network Control Model
	  Device USB Class Specification). The CDC NCM specification is
	  available from <http://www.usb.org/>.

	  Say "y" to link the driver statically, or "m" to build a
	  dynamically linked module.

	  This driver should work with at least the following devices:
	    * ST-Ericsson M700 LTE FDD/TDD Mobile Broadband Modem (ref. design)
	    * ST-Ericsson M5730 HSPA+ Mobile Broadband Modem (reference design)
	    * ST-Ericsson M570 HSPA+ Mobile Broadband Modem (reference design)
	    * ST-Ericsson M343 HSPA Mobile Broadband Modem (reference design)
	    * Ericsson F5521gw Mobile Broadband Module

config USB_NET_CDC_MBIM
	tristate "CDC MBIM support"
	depends on USB_USBNET
	select USB_WDM
	select USB_NET_CDC_NCM
	help
	  This driver provides support for CDC MBIM (Mobile Broadband
	  Interface Model) devices. The CDC MBIM specification is
	  available from <http://www.usb.org/>.

	  MBIM devices require configuration using the management
	  protocol defined by the MBIM specification.  This driver
	  provides unfiltered access to the MBIM control channel
	  through the associated /dev/cdc-wdmx character device.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cdc_mbim.
